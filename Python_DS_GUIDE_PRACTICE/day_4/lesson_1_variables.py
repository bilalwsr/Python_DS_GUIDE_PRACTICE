# hello, today we are going to learn about variales 

# why we use variables?
# Ans: it reduces the human effort for coding
# easy to write for long data sets 
# easy to recall

# here is the example: samosa = ("aloo", "chicken", "maida", "dhania", "namak")
# so in line 8 we have assigned a samosa(as variable) to all ingrediants that are used
# in samosa.

# strategy
# 1. use variable except reserved words
# 2. don't ever write variable names with spaces
# 3. don't capitalize the variable
# 4. use short variable names (max_2_words) example: aloo_chat
# 5. don't start variable names with numbers and special characters
# 6. variable should be meaningful, related names to data set
# 7. follow global trends (df = data frames)
# 8. don't repeat same variable.
# 9. don't use operators in variables.

# some practice time

fruit_basket = ("banana", "mangoes", "pears", "apples", "watermelos")
print(fruit_basket)

x = 2+5+6**6-456
print(x)

# how to check the tye of variable

print(type(x)) #here the type of variable is integer

print(type(fruit_basket)) #here is type of variable (fruit_basket) is tuple
