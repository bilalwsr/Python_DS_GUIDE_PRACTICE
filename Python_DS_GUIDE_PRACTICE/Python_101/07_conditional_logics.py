# here we are again and now we are going to study about Conditional Logics
# so these are logical operators are either yes or no, true or false, 0 or 1

#       ==  this sign is known as equal to
#       !=  this sign is known as not equal to
#       <   this sign is known as less than
#       >   this sign is known as greater than
#      >=   this sign as known as greater than and equal to
#      <=   this sign is known is less than and equal to
# usage of logical operators
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)

# application of logical operators
# sufiyan who is my young brother wants to go to school, 

# sufiyan_age = 4
# age_at_school = 5
# print(sufiyan_age==age_at_school)

# using input operators and logics

sufiyan_age = input("how old is sufiyan") #input function
sufiyan_age = int(sufiyan_age)
age_at_school = 5  
print(sufiyan_age==age_at_school) #logic operator
