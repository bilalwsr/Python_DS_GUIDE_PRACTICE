# in chapter 05 we are going to learn about variables

# objects containg specific values for example: x = 5
x = 5
print(x)


y = ("we are legends")
print(y)


x = 15+5
print(x)

z = 495494.33445

# how to check type of variable?
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))


# Rules to assign variable
# 1. variables must be in letters, numbers, or underscores.
# 2. do not start with numbers 
# 3. spaces are not allowed in variables.
# 4. do not use reserved keywords
# 5. variables must be short and discriptive
# 6. case sensivity, always use lower case letters


fruits = "mangoes, grapes, bananas, dates"
print(fruits)
print(type(fruits)) #if we write del fruits it will delete all fruits.
